## About The Project
This plugin adds an option in the context menu that tweaks the `dazn.com` media player.
It does this by removing the side panel, which shows statistics about the game.
This allows the media player to be expanded.
> *__Note__*: You need to reload after you went back to the home screen.

### Built With

* The icon was created by [juicy_fish](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/juicy-fish) and can be downloaded 
[here](https://www.flaticon.com/de/kostenloses-icon/videoplayer_9482573?term=player&page=1&position=95&origin=search&related_id=9482573)


### Getting Started

Open the *__about:debugging__* page in *firefox*, click the *__This Firefox__* option, click the
Load Temporary Add-on button, then select any file in your extension's directory.
